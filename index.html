        <h1 class="recipe-name">Baked Ziti</h1>
        <p>Ziti is a hollow pasta in the shape of a smooth tube, 
          sort of like a short straw. It originated in Campagna, 
          Italy, or perhaps Sicily, Italy. Its name means bride or bridegroom, 
          although the stories of why the Italians gave this pasta the name for those getting married can vary. 
          In some parts of Italy, it's served at weddings.
